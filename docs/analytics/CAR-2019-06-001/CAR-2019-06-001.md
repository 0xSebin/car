[ProcDump](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/downloads/procdump) is a sysinternal command-line utility whose primary purpose is monitoring an application for CPU spikes and generating crash dumps during a spike that an administrator or developer can use to determine the cause of the spike. 

Procdump is also being used by attackers nowadays for malicious purpose to dump the process memory like lsass and use it for credentials harvesting. Tools like Mimikatz can be further used to parse/read the credentials from the procdump files of lsass.exe. 
The detection process of credential dumping method is generally attempted by an attacker in 2 steps.
  1. First performing procdump of lsass process and
  2. Second running tools like Mimikatz to get credentials from dump.
In this CAR we are trying to detect the first step of the process mentioned above.

## Implementations

### Common procdump GrantedAccess Patterns (Splunk, Sysmon native)

```
index=__your_sysmon_data__ EventCode=10 
TargetImage="C:\\WINDOWS\\system32\\lsass.exe"
GrantedAccess="0x1FFFFF" ("procdump")
```
