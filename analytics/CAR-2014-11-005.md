## Description
An adversary can remotely [manipulate the registry](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1112) of another machine if the RemoteRegistry service is enabled and valid credentials are obtained. While the registry is remotely accessed, it can be used to prepare a [Lateral Movement](https://attack.mitre.org/tactics/TA0008) technique, [discover](https://attack.mitre.org/tactics/TA0007) the configuration of a host, achieve [Persistence](https://attack.mitre.org/tactics/TA0003), or anything that aids an adversary in achieving the mission. Like most ATT&CK techniques, this behavior can be used legitimately, and the reliability of an analytic depends on the proper identification of the pre-existing legitimate behaviors. Although this behavior is disabled in many Windows configurations, it is possible to [remotely enable](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1035) the RemoteRegistry service, which can be detected with [CAR-2014-03-005](CAR-2014-03-005.md).

## ATT&CK Detection

|Technique |Tactic |Level of Coverage |
|---|---|---|
|[Modify Registry](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1112/)|[Lateral Movement](https://attack.mitre.org/tactics/TA0008), [Defense Evasion](https://attack.mitre.org/tactics/TA0005)|Moderate|

## Pseudocode
```
flows = search Flow:Message
winreg = filter flows where (dest_port == 445 and proto_info.pipe == "WINREG")
winreg_modify = filter flows where (proto_info.function == "Create*" or proto_info.function == "SetValue*")

output winreg_modify
```

## Additional Notes: 

Remote access to the registry can be achieved via
* Windows API function <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/ms724840.aspx">RegConnectRegistry</a> 
* command line via `reg.exe`
* graphically via `regedit.exe`
All of these behaviors call into the Windows API, which uses the NamedPipe `WINREG` over SMB to handle the protocol information. This network can be decoded with wireshark or a similar sensor, and can also be detected by hooking the API function.
