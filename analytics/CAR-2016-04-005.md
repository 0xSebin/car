## Description
A remote desktop logon, through [RDP](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1076/), may be typical of a system administrator or IT support, but only from select workstations. Monitoring remote desktop logons and comparing to known/approved originating systems can detect lateral movement of an adversary.
