# CAR-2016-03-002: Create Remote Process via WMIC
- Submission Date: 2016/03/28
- Information Domain: Host
- Host Subtypes: Process
- Analytic Type: TTP

## Description
Adversaries may use [Windows Management Instrumentation](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1047) (WMI) to move laterally, by launching executables remotely.The analytic [CAR-2014-12-001](CAR-2014-12-001.md) describes how to detect these processes with network traffic monitoring and process monitoring on the target host. However, if the command line utility `wmic.exe` is used on the source host, then it can additionally be detected on an analytic. The command line on the source host is constructed into something like `wmic.exe /node:"\<hostname\>" process call create "\<command line\>"`. It is possible to also connect via IP address, in which case the string `"\<hostname\>"` would instead look like `IP Address`. 

## ATT&CK Detection

|Technique |Tactic |Level of Coverage |

|[Windows Management Instrumentation](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1047/)|[Execution](https://attack.mitre.org/tactics/TA0002)||



## Pseudocode
Looks for instances of `wmic.exe` as well as the substrings in the command line 
* `process call create`
* `/node:`

```
processes = search Process:Create
wmic = filter processes where (exe == "wmic.exe" and command_line == "* process call create *" and command_line == "* /node:*")
output wmic
```

## Additional Notes: 

Although this analytic was created after [CAR-2014-12-001](CAR-2014-12-001.md), it is a much simpler (although more limited) approach. Processes can be created remotely via WMI in a few other ways, such as more direct API access or the built-in utility [PowerShell](https://attack.mitre.org/T1086).
