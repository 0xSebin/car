  [ProcDump](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/downloads/procdump) is a sysinternal command-line utility whose primary purpose is monitoring an application for CPU spikes and generating crash dumps during a spike that an administrator or developer can use to determine the cause of the spike. 

  Procdump is also used by attackers for malicious purposes such as dumping process memory from lsass and using this dump for credential harvesting. Tools like Mimikatz can be further used to parse/read the credentials from the procdump files of lsass.exe. 

  This process of credential dumping as performed by an attacker consists of two steps.
    1. Performing the procdump of the lsass process
    2. Running tools like Mimikatz to get credentials from the dump
  In this analytic we are trying to detect the first step of the above process.

  Note - the CAR data model currently does not support process access actions, so there is no pseudocode implementation for this analytic.
