description: 'The Windows built-in tool `schtasks.exe` provides the creation, modification, and running of [scheduled tasks](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1053) on a local or remote computer. It is provided as a more flexible alternative to `at.exe`, described in [CAR-2013-05-004](CAR-2013-05-004). Although used by adversaries, the tool is also legitimately used by administrators, scripts, and software configurations. The scheduled tasks tool can be used to gain [Persistence](https://attack.mitre.org/tactics/TA0003) and can be used in combination with a [Lateral Movement](https://attack.mitre.org/tactics/TA0008) technique to remotely gain [execution](https://attack.mitre.org/tactics/TA0002). Additionally, the command has parameters to specify the user and password responsible for creating the task, as well as the user and password combination that the task will run as. The `/s` flag will cause a task to run as the SYSTEM user, usually indicating [privilege escalation](https://attack.mitre.org/tactics/TA0004).'
